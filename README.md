# TicTacToe

A simple Clojure app written to learn functional programming and Clojure itself. I tried to make it as easy to read as possible. Hopefully someone will be able to learn from it in the future. Enjoy!

## Usage

If you have nothing to do you, can use this code to play tic-tac-toe against your computer. I should warn you that computer moves are random, so don't expect to have fun for long :)

Also, if you want to play it multiple times using REPL, you need to reset available-moves to its original state.
